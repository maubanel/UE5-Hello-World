Now to control it in game we need to add a camera to the scene.  We will have the camera rotate around our creation to create a sort of turntable effect.

Now when you click on the camera in the **World Outliner**

##### `Step 1.`\|`UE5HW`|:small_blue_diamond:

Go to **Place Actors** and type `Camera` and drag a **All Classes | Camera Actor** into the scene.  Now when you select the actor in the **Outliner** you will see a picture in picture with the camera view.

##### `Step 2.`\|`FHIU`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

In Unreal you can take any existing actor and turn it into a **Blueprint** that you can reuse or add extra logitc that doesn't exist in the current actor.  This can be done in the **Details** panel.

Now we want to make a blueprint to add logic to it so that it rotates around its center.  Click on the <kbd>Add Script</kbd> button and call it `BP_Camera` and place it in the root of the **Content** folder. In the ***Creaet Blueprint from Selection** menu leave the defaults and press the <kbd>Select</kbd>button.

##### `Step 3.`\|`UE5HW`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now you should see a new **Blueprint** based on the camera actor in the root **Content** folder called **BP_Camera**.

![turn actor to BP](images/NameCamBP.png)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 4.`\|`UE5HW`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Open the newly created **Blueprint**.  Sometimes it will open in a reduced view and if it does you need to click on the link for **Open Full Blueprint Editor**.

In the **Components** tab, press the **+ Add** button and search for `Billboard`.  Add this component to the scene.  This will act as the target that the camera looks at but will not be rendered in the level.  It will stay at the local **0, 0, 0** coordinate so this will be the rotation point for the camera to rotate around the level.

##### `Step 5.`\|`UE5HW`| :small_orange_diamond:


Press **+ Add** again to add a `Rotating Movement` component.

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 6.`\|`UE5HW`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

The camera needs to be around 3/4 of the length of the ground surface away from the billboard.  The billboard will be in the middle of the floor and the camera will look at it and rotate around it.  This will take some trial and error but for now select the **Camera Component** and move it away with the **Red** arrow from the **Billboard**.

##### `Step 7.`\|`UE5HW`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Make sure the billboard component is at a **Location** where you want to rotate around the letters.  Centering it works for me.   Make sure the **Camera Component** is far enough away to see the letters fully.  Go back to the blueprint and adjust the distance as required.  Use the camera preview to see the framing of the camera. I have it here so that the object is position and rotated with the pivot point in the right place.

##### `Step 8.`\|`UE5HW`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

We need to attach the camera to a player.  So we need to add a **Game Mode**. 

There are two places we can select the level blueprint.  In the **Project Settings | Maps & Modes** we can set it for the entire project.  We will leave this alone as it works with their test level in the framework we imported.  

We can have a unique gamemode for a specific level. Lets do it this way. Go to the **World Settings** tab (if it is not there go to **Window | World Settings**) and selecting a **Game Mode Override** of `GameModeBase`. 

![global game mode in project settings](images/gamemodeBase.png)


<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 9.`\|`UE5HW`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Press the **Play** button and we no longer see the third person pawn.  We DO NOT see the camera rotate around the object.  Woops the camera is static.  What is happening?  The game is still using the spectator pawn camera will not use this camera unless you tell it to. Notice it spawns a second camera that in my case points at nothing.  It must be bound to the **Default Pawn** as the camera moves when I press **WASD** on the keyboard.  

This is default behavior in Unreal. It expects the user the be controlling a character and since we do not have one, it creates one for us using the default pawn so you can fly around the scene.  Notice that in the **World Outliner** that you see the other **Camera Actor**.  You will also still see the **BP_CameraActor** and if you click on it will see that the frame is changing so it is rotating.

Lets fix this and use our desired camera.

##### `Step 10.`\|`UE5HW`| :large_blue_diamond:

Every level comes with its own blueprint where you can put level specific scripts.  When you save a map/level the game automatically creates a level blueprint.  This is where we will tell the game to use our new camera.  You can load it by pressing the <kbd>Blueprints</kbd> button and select **Open Level Blueprint**.


![open level blueprint](images/OpenLevelBP.jpg)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 11.`\|`UE5HW`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Now you can see that the blueprint has the same name as the map.  Make sure you are in the **Event Graph**, this is where all your game logic will go.  Notice the **Begin Play Event**.  This event will run **once** when you start the game.  So our script needs to make our new camera the game camera instead of the spectator pawn.  Right click on the graph and search for a **GetPlayerController** node.

![get player controller](images/GetPlayerController.jpg)

##### `Step 12.`\|`UE5HW`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Pull off of the **Return Value** pin and add a **Set View Target with Blend** node.

![set view target with blend](images/SetViewTargetWithBlend.jpg)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 13.`\|`UE5HW`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:  :small_blue_diamond: 

Go to the game window and select the Camera blueprint actor in the scene.

![select camera actor in game level](images/SelectCameraActor.jpg)

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 14.`\|`UE5HW`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:  :small_blue_diamond: 

Go back to the **Blueprint** and right click on the graph.  Select **Create a Reference to BP_Camera**.  Connect the **Execution** pin from the **Begin Play** node and send it to the **Set View Target With Blend** execution pin.  Connect the output of the camera node to the **Get Player Controller** pin in the **Target** node. 

Connect the output of the camera node to the **New View Target** pin in the **Set View Target with Blend** node.

##### `Step 15.`\|`UE5HW`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: 

Compile the blueprint then go to the game and press run.  The camera should now rotate around the billboard showing off your work.  It is a bit fast though..

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 16.`\|`UE5HW`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond:   :small_blue_diamond: 

Lets adjust the speed and position of the camera.  Open the **BP_Camera_Actor** blueprint.  Select the **Rotating Movement** component. Change the  **Rotation Rate | Z** value from `180` degrees per second to `20`.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5504953/125643100-a0516b9e-2196-4926-8ca9-6cdefb5c2014.mp4

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x2/45D7CA/45D7CA" alt="drawing" height="2px" alt = ""/>

##### `Step 17.`\|`UE5HW`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:


Now to reverse the direction we just make it `-20` degrees per second on the **Rotation Rate | Z** value and the camera will rotate in the opposite direction.

##### `Step 18.`\|`UE5HW`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Create the rest of the letters to spell out the words **Hello World**.  Play around with the different static meshes and effects they provide to make it look as cool as you can.  You might have to adjust the size of the letters so they all fit on the ground (or expand the ground plane). Your final project should look something like this. Make sure you name your files appropriately and put all your cubes in folders that are clearly labelled.
